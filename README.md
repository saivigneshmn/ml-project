ResNet50-DCT Feature Fusion for Automated Image Captioning in Telugu


## Brief Description
This project introduces an innovative automated image captioning system that leverages a unique combination of ResNet50 and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) features to generate accurate and descriptive captions in Telugu. The system employs a dual-feature extraction approach, incorporating both ResNet50 for high-level semantic information and DCT for low-level visual details, to create comprehensive feature vectors for input images.
